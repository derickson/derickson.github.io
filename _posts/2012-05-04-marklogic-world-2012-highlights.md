  <span style="text-align: left;">My favorite parts of the conference in no particular order:</span>
</p>

  * Demonstrations of features from early builds of MarkLogic 5.1 (Plex)
  * An excellent discussion on the architecture of dynamic semantic publishing at BBC from Jem Rayfield ([blog post][1])
  * The huge number of customer presentations
  * Discussing reporting, analytics, and visualization approaches for Big Data
  * Party at the National Air and Space Museum
  * Bumping into XQuery hackers I hadn&#8217;t seen in person for years, and some I only knew from the Interwebs
  * Being able to metro home
