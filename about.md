I, Dave, am a software engineer living in the DC Metro region. I can be reached through [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-erickson/26/28b/67b).

I am writing this blog as a way to stave off the atrophy of my writing skills and to document the tips and tricks I learn while coding.  What’s the point of finding a clever workaround or getting excited about code if I can’t share it with anyone?
